# Preliminary Analysis - ESA 2026
## -------------------------------------------------------- ##
# Purpose:
## Preliminary Analysis of PL Data for ESA Abstract
## Three morphological traits are "leaf_area_cm2", "infl_length_cm", and "int_length"
## We want to know how these change in native vs invasive ranges (range column)

# Hypothesis:
## We hypothesized leaf area, inflorescence length and internode length all 
### might increase in invasive ranges due to release from competition, 
### but some groups found interesting patterns suggesting a tradeoff
### (e.g., longer internode length but smaller leaf area)
## Eventually we want to see if latitude is an important factor as well, (and year of record)
