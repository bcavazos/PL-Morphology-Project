# Preliminary Analysis of PL Data for ESA Abstract

# three morphological traits are leaf_area_cm2, infl_length_cm, and int_length

# we want to know how these change in native vs invasive ranges (range column)

# we hypothesized leaf area, inflorescence length and internode length all 
# might increase in invasive ranges due to release from competition, 
# but some groups found interesting patterns suggesting a tradeoff (longer internode length, but smaller leaf area, etc)

# eventually we want to see if latitude is an important factor as well, (and year of record)
